LIEING IN THE ROAD:
As we drove round the corner the van in front suddenly stopped
& pulled up onto the curb. Lying prone in the road, an old man
driving a mobility scooter lay trapped beneath his toppled chariot.
Moving dazed in slow motion panic like a giant crab aware that
traffic was baring down on him & unable to do a thing about it.
