to touch	to taste
she flows like a river of bass vibration
to touch 	to taste
she flows like a river of bass vibration
sweet water
sweet water
to touch 	to taste
you flow like a river of bass vibration
sunshine surrounds me
showering a perfect green
sunshine surrounds me
showering a perfect green
to touch 	to taste
you flow like a river of bass vibration
to touch 	to taste
you flow like a river of bass vibration
took me 
down
down
down
down
down
to your river of sweet release
took me 
down
down
down
down
down
down
to your river of sweet relief
everyone is sleeping
this need and this release
sitting on a mountain
cool breeze could see
listening to a whisper
to touch 	to taste
you flow like a river of bass vibration
to touch 	to taste
you flow like a river of bass vibration
what is in the thornbush
the thornbush in my head
i'm a snowstorm
i'm a shaker
sometimes i regret the things i said
to touch	to taste
she flows like a river of bass vibration
to touch 	to taste
she flows like a river of bass vibration
took me 
down
down
down
down
down
down
to your river of sweet release
took me 
down
down
down
down
down
down
to your river of sweet release
from chelsea to essex
in every room 
in every sweet coccoon
from chelsea to essex
in every room 
in every sweet coccoon
sometimes i feel her coming from the other side of the world
sometimes i feel her coming from the other side of the world
to touch 	to taste
she flows like a river of bass vibration...
