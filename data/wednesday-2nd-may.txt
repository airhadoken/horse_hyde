WAITING FOR A WORD:
Some days the words won't come out to play. You look out your eyes
& wait for sound, but it won't come -- not even the sound of the wind
to kickstart thinking. There was a mist, I'll admit, like a memory
of Wales, but that refused to say anything more than,
"I'm here, get your own ideas!"
