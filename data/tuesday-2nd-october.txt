WORDS:
Another day in the Emerald City writing/recording one've the projects.
The poetry on the trains is the same only coloured browns & greys.
Trying to write about some one's life, keep it straight not go "poetic"
or "lyrical", just let it out onto the page. Piecing together words out've
bit's of emails & texts to friends, where the poetry is fresher than
straight out the pen. Trying to capture images in words to get past
that sweet misunderstanding that this is some kind've "stream
of consciousness' Beat thing. Listening to the Persuasians -
"Street Corner Symphony". It's a good day for it.
