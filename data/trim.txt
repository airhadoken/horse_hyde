he-he-heat in your skin
pull up a chair and unwind 
dog we don't share 
the taxi left us behind 
silhouette of a psychic reader in the market 
and the straw wrapped around a bottle to take home 
barbeque chicken oil in a drum, double strong wrong 
here comes the horn you call for 
woman in a box with her head in her box 
speaks french when spoken like a tourist french 
hey classic coca-cola in a can when you wanna cool down
heat, she move up the street in waves 
sugar, sugar, clear your mind leave it all behind 
get in the boat and float 
join in on a high spot and ride, ride 
put on some smile 
stay for a while
