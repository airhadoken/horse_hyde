JOURNEYS OF DUST:
The dust kicked up by our journeys filters the sun.
The colours of the earth dance in the wind, a sound-clash of images.
Noises of the mouths of commuters muted to underscore the day.
Trains rammed to the gills on weekends filled with wide eyed
out of towners & the bleary expressions of heat stroked long
distance travellers come to witness the spectacular & return home
clutching souvenirs.
