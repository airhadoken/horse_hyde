Last night with eyes closing at the wheel struggling to see the road
with the radio for company, prayers & incantations, surfing stations,
windows wide, wind blown hair erect & a-feared like a dub-gonk.
Going through lists of outstanding things with the first bless-ed tea
listening to Espen Erikson Trio "What Took You So Long"
