DAY OF PARTS:
Some daze you start out with clear intentions & the forces moves the road underneath
your wheels no matter what direction you try to drive in. Essex opened it's eyes in
day-glow fog. The sun set in a crystal sky. Now a full-fat moon is grinning down at us,
come to swing moods in exaggerated arcs. I sat in the studio, I sat with brother Smith,
I sat in the car reading Hockney & made new artworks on the iPad. I love that thing,
it's my electric paper, a note book, collector of fragmentary ideas.
