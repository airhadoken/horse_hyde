OFF TO MEET THE WIZARD:
Overnight rain outside, heard from deep within the folds of bedsheets
is one've my favourite sounds & though the sunlight on the Spanish plain
made me feel good the low grey light & thick clouds covering us this morning
is exactly what I need today as I catch a train into the Emerald City.
Off to work again with the Great Wizard on a collection of new tracks
we're percolating in the back room.
