THIS ONE'S FOR YOU JOHN:
The rain washed the heat down the drain & this morning
as we showered in a cacophony of birdsong -- soaking our
best trainers in the long grass. The day smelled clean & green
like a new-start. You could see molecules doing jigs & reels emitting
sulphurous sparks of energy that caught in our clothes & made us feel
that anything was possible as we walked out to meet the sun.
