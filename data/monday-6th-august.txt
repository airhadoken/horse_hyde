THE DANCE OF THE WOODEN BOYS:
They were beautiful when I came to throw them in the bin.
We struck a deal for them to be photographed before I did.
I'm glad, they were right, they were on to something I'd
trained to recognise from years of trawling streets & alleys,
camera in hand. So beautiful was their dance that for once
I heard no sound nor saw any shape erupt from their cavorting.
It was as if their gyrations were so frantic they had danced
themselves into the eye of  the storm.  
Listening to Brian Eno's new Installation piece for Turin.
