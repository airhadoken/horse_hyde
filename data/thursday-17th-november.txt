IN SEARCH OF EROTIC ARCHITECTURE:
Found a delicate stain in fat & juice in the newsprint we wrapped
last years Christmas pudding in. Caught a train into the East End
of the City of Dreams to pick poetry off itâ€™s streets & document the
changes since they deposited enormous buildings there with erotic
curves. I heard they got a shopping mall from another planet -
on the journey for company.
