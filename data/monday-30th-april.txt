I GREW TO LOVE:
I found you waiting in the rain, between the hairdressers
& the sweet shop that served generations. The holiday makers who
used to come from cities lined the streets, licking hand made ices,
riding steam trains into summer. Boom days for a backwater town
who's youth detest it's never-change yet grow to love the very things
that drove them away into the hungry arms of the bright lights.
