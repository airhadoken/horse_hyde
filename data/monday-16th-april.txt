STRIPES?!:
Great to see Bruno, Jonny & Benedict pick up awards for best lighting
& best actors last night at the Oliviers. Jonny's speech was touching
& displayed why he's such a cool bloke to work with. The unexpected
surprise of Brian May rocking out put a smile on everyone's face
& the four Matilda's made what will probably remain my favourite
team acceptance speech of all time.
A right Royal night out at the Opera.
