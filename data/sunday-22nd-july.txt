Another beautiful day in england rising to radio transmissions that
dovetail celebration with horror & mourning pictures of joy interlaced
with fear, revulsion, numbers, times, temperatures, figures, finance,
speed & duration, all calculated in the same breath as lives. Families,
communities, young & old the radio waves, like the events they carry don't
discriminate between anyone as they carry their relentless messages
to us all. Turn the radio on, turn it off, the waves, like the stories
they transmit will keep coming, radiating out beyond our earth
to where we are no more than a tiny spec of light. All history as we
know it happened right there on there spec, all lives lived, loved or taken.
In memory
