A day of travelling from one end of the city to the other, tube trains
strewn with discarded news as commuters cover summer pastels
in black & brown. In the studio builders come & go & skips
are filled during vocal takes. A distraction from the thoughts in my
head that get so ordinary it requires whole construction teams
to distract the thinking into  letting something extraordinary out.
