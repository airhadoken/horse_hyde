FAMILY:
The best news on waking is that the living have maintained our numbers
& all found something else to laugh about. Families either rift & drift
or get drawn together & I'm proud to be part of the latter. Third day here
in the studio on a project as yet undefined but generating great slabs
of joy. There's a lot to tell you about ...  in time -
not just Treading Water
