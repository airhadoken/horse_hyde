IN HOLLAND WITH A BANANA:
Local crews have done a beautiful job here in Holland, production
details high & rising. Bacon & eggs wait back stage in rooms decked
out with gnomes & ladybirds. No clue what the theme is yet, it all feels
a bit surreal as we tumble out've our sleeping holes & into the freezing
light of the sun. It's no wonder so much great art came out've this country
with light like this & centuries of architecture incorporating "big windows"
that let the light sing around the room & lift your spirits. Tonight is one've
those strange curve-ball stage configurations -- a lot've scaffolding
& different levels to test your dancing skills. The body still feels
underpowered & a lot've flu flying around on the bus. The head wants to
duvet dive, but the heart wants a good laugh -standing at the crossroads.
