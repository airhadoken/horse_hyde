WET FEET:
Yeah, thereâ€™s a leak & the floors are flooded just like back in student daze.
Feels like visit for old times sake of a forgotten lodger as we paddle about
before dawn. Took a walk to watch the sunrise, photograph scribbled
branches dance. Deep Purple, to Orange, to Yellow, to white. Switch off
the stress machine, turn off the conscious collider, stand still & let the day
come to us not racing into it like a bull. The sun burns off the cloud,
Naked trees raise their arms in hallelujah & stars turn into planes
bringing smiling faces home.
