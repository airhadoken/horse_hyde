DID YOU DREAM?:
Did you ever dream the End of the World, watching everything you loved
slowly slip beneath the flood? Did you ever witness the unthinkable happen,
or loose your faith for a fraction of a second? Did you take a walk along a road
you taken hundreds of times, only to find it didn't go to the place you were
sure it would arrive?
