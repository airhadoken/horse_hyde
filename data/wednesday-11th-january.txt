GONE:
Gone to talk to Germany: Gone to talk to London: Gone to talk to Writers:
Gone to talk to Directors: Gone to talk to Art Collectors:
Gone to talk to the Dirty Streets:
Gone to talk to Music makers: Gone to talk to Coffee & Bun:
Gone to talk to Myself: Gone to talk to a Machine in my hand:
Gone to talk to Strangers: Gone to talk to Friends:
Gone to talk to the Mirror in the Bathroom: Gone to talk to anyone
who wants words: Gone to find out what it's like on the outside
& mostly...  Gone to Listen.
