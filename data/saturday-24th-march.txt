DANCING WOOD:
Today I found a tree dancing naked & wild offering hands up to the sky
in reverend celebration. An act of faith in living wood, a prayer given up
to a benevolent sky. I watch transfixed as sounds cascade from beneath
it's zig-zag arms. Assured that Duchamp's brides in all their glorious
descends could not be more beautiful than this gentle act of gratitude.
