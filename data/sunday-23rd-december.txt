COUNTRY STYLE:
The ceaseless rain falls onto fields, fields turn into sponges,
empty into country lanes, roads become rivers, homes become
islands, families stranded, a simple trip to the shops becomes
impossible, neighbours become life savers, lifelines to essential
supplies & city folk appreciate the beauty of battered LandRovers.
