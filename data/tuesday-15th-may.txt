IN MEMORY OF PREVIOUS: 
Dust. I tasted you again beneath the feet of millions whose skins,
like fine mist blown for us to inhale sweet on swift electric winds.
The mouths of  dirty tunnels howl in threatening concealment of such
nightmares that relax in darkness waiting. Subterranean sirens songs
call out to lonely mariners, come stumble down to seek the steely twins
whose eyes gone blind from staring too long up into a thin fluorescent sun.
The bell, it swings so dark, it tolls so silent for the ears of waifs & strays alone drunks come dancing prettily propelled by rhythms only they can hear, beers diluted with tears, but this last is not for you & me today my dears.
(congratulations to all at 6 Music for last night's well deserved award)
