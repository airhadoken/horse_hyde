BEAUTIFUL DAY:
On the way to the station a boy in long-coat, long hair like Bryan May
stands in the doorway to his flat & gives me the salute.
"New Party"
"What?"
"New Party"
He looks trouble so I feign a lack of English & keep walking under
the bridgeÂ where a strange substance oozes out've the bricks.
