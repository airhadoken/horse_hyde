STUDYING:
The Sight of Silence: John Cage's Complete Watercolors.
Walking back from the Royal College of Art end of year show
I called into the Serpentine Gallery book shop to pick up a copy
of RAW VISION magazine & on a random browse
(the kind you can't do on line) discovered this fantastic book.
Builders in customary hi-viz waste coats grazed the
lawn outside applying finishing touches to this years
pavilion as robust security, swathed in black tradition,
watched over them like kindly shepherds on a
Constable hillside.
