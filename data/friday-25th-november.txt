Oh the excuses that used to roll off the tongue! Greeted the day before sunrise as usual then suddenly it was later. Emerging from a darkened studio the sun leaves us squinting cherishing memories of summer, watching trees dance naked in the wind doing scribble against a clear blue sky like the first time in New York.
