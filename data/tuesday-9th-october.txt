WHAT'S IN THE BOX?:
Waking in a bubble of dense fog which fortunately sits outside the head.
Toru flew in from Tokyo last night to begin making artworks out've bits
of Essex. He's got me to find a box & I'm carrying it into London. What he
wants with the box is yet to be revealed, but I've learned that, when it
comes to the creative process "understanding" intent "before' action limits
possibilities. So, I'm carrying a box into London... .let you know how it goes.
