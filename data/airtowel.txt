jane is waiting
in your software
in your blouse
in your denim
carrying
her new software
little black thing
is electric
and the breathing
and the breathing
and the brave
all she says now
and he says
come on fuck this
i'm no woman
i'm a maniac
i'm on trade
i'm not paying
senseless geezer
where the doors are opening
with electric
arm or piston
in the tubehole
it is sliding
full of moisture
getting on now
with his both hands
on the red poles
on the red poles
should i want it...
barefoot...
