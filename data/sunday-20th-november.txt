ON THE FLIP-SIDE OF THE LEAF:
The conversation turns to travel, the companionship of radio that helps maintaina valued link with home. Voices in dialects & rhythms with the power to dispel the alone-ness & bring on a smile of recognition, remembering where everyone back home will be with each broadcast.
"What’s gonna happen to all these radio’s when analogue finally gets turned off?"you asked, recalling the glow of dusty valves illuminating glass dials printed with the names of exotic cities around the world. Radio Moscow one end of the dial, Morse Code up the other.
"What will become of analogue lovers when it all goes digital?" -- you said.
They’ll all become the possessors of silent doorstops & paperweights.
