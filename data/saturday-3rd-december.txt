AAAAAAAAAHHHH!:
Woke up in the fast lane of the M1. Looked out the window at a sunrise
so gloriously black & white it sucked the colour out've the world. Only
the clouds, deceptive in their livery of greys were actually festooned
in purple hews crowned with fragile pinks. Got a feeling a lot've stuff
is going to be talking to me today -- noises & shapes jumping out've
everything -- plenty to write & paint about.
