ANOTHER WEIRD START TO THE DAY:
Me & an owl at 4:00 -- me on this lap top at the kitchen table.
the owl in a tree outside the kitchen window. Hoot-hoot, tap-tap-tap.
Some one in asleep outside Birmingham gets an email, someone sweating
in California sun gets one, someone in NewYork City find one waiting
when they come in from the night. As the sun rises over Essex I slip
dreamscape of barbed wire, caves & precarious concrete towers.
