A night of sleepless fears & violent nightmares follows a beautiful day -
ain't it often the way? It's a question of balance & with sunlight sending
shadows long & black, who am I to argue when it calls us out to dance?
craving more descriptions of his studios & working conditions -- the
artist adapting to his financial position & making something extraordinary
out've what he's given.
