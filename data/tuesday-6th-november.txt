It was Fish n Chips all round, the night before we went down to the quay
to wave Shady's ship off. The morning was clear as crystal, sharp as a pin
& freezing. Men tipped their hats as we passed & we made note of their
names. Shadows  lined the road, standing to attention as is customary
for a man who lived with honour & earned the right to sail a ship reserved
for only the finest.
