WHEN "NO" IS "YES':
When you loose someone you love it's like half of you is in a car crash
& the other half has to get on with the shopping. This is extreme
multi-tasking, noting you could sell to the cable channels to fill
the schedules with more lo-fi reality interest. This is imaginary
nightmare stuff that jumps through the TV & grabs you by the throat
like that film where the house disappears back into it's self, leaving
no human trace. Well when you loose someone you really love it's
like that -- suddenly they're just a figment of your imagination.
I have a great imagination it seems. Listening to 2in1 to pick me up
