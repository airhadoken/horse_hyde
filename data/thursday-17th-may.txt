WHEN I WAS FIRST IN LA: 
I bought a huge old console at a yard sale -- a long sideboard of a thing .
The left third was a great valve radio, 12" speaker AMAZING sound.
In the centre was a 16" TV -- and to the right was a turntable on top
and slats to store albums underneath.  But the TV was long gone,
and instead there was this TV shaped opening to an empty plywood box.
an ornament or flowers in there -- but when it was empty we'd call it
TV for The Blind...  years later Derek Jarman made Blue -- and it looked
like something that had already screened on my telly.
