HOT TOO HOT:
Too hot too early house sucking heat in plugged into a computer that
generates sound but today the sounds don't turn into violent forms &
I don't know why maybe it has something to do with the company?
Good company doesn't radiate violence & sounds don't transform into
shapes that hurt. Listening to grooves emerge & a language evolve
between writers who have never met yet make music that lifts
the spirit like it's been written solely with that purpose -- attuned to
the bio-rhythms of everyone in the room.
Wouldn't it be cool if all music came from the heart?
