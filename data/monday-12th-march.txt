MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND:
It has been a year since tragic earthquake in north eastern Japan.
I have been so pleased and thankful to my friends abroad
who have been so helpful and generous.
My despair healed by friends. My angst cleared often by just
connecting to them.
I know an escaping group was isolated, one mother e-mailed her son in
London about her situation. son tweeted what is happening in the
escaping site, asked for help and spread the situation. A third person
re-tweet it and hours later mother was rescued.
So I know we can help people from thousands of miles away.
As long as I have friends who care, I feel vibrant.
Thank you for your care.
