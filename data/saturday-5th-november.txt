AND THE HOPE OF THE WORLD:
Woke up with Hockney painting Autumn on my brain. Been listening to the dance
in the colour of the leaves -- how to translate it. New work in the pipe & on the mind
every morning. Down in the city as the sky gets dull shop illuminationsÂ get theirÂ
Dickensian glow on. For a second there I lost communication with the words thatÂ
tumble out've everything. Head was in a box, a storm, a fog. That;s when you
got to step back, take a look at the bigger picture. Goodmorning Mr Hockney.Â
