if they don't 
know they don't know they're gonna find out soon enough i'm so hot as 
if that hurt did you wash it fester it around some you don't even have 
to wind your own stuff bring in the marines 
i've heard
so many other things and it was all brown we're the suction 
ones the ones that suck it up and i don't ever do the aisle until i did that 
thing i'll bet you'd like a blue boost try a new roost 
loosen the strap 
with the two metal ends rest your head against the steel blow into the 
tube show me your legs help me show me your pinksmile walking up the 
aisle show me the thing underneath the seat show me your tiny plastic 
something a song like a squealing pig like a train with wheels 
in the 
dark with the lights off concealed i'm thinking of you still
