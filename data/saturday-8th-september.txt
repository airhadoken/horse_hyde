Loved ones sleep in hospitals, sunrise is beautiful over South Essex.
New music in the studio, new art for distant lands, new cultures to jam with
scheduled for the months to come. The sky is crystal clear, even the flies
don't want to detract from it's calming beauty. Last night talking to my
Grandfather's photograph we laughed like he was still around & he showed
me the view of reality from the luxury of his look-out, high on a sunlit hill.
It's good to have someone around you can confide in & trust.
Back behind the wheel today I offer up a prayer for the sick & suffering,
put the XX on the stereo & drive.
