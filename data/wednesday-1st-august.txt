We pulled into the gated yard of an East End warehouse conversion,
our driver slipping his little town car between an ivory Morgan & a
decommissioned staff car. Giant bronze forearms towered over the back
yards between apartments that abutted the art casters workshops
& the paintings in the hall were were strictly top drawer abstract.
The decor of the apartment was decay but we were greeted with smiles,
warmth & thrills as the band waited in the basement, tuning their custom
contraptions. You could feel the fizz of anticipation as we unloaded bags
of  bottled water, jelly babies & 70% chocolate. Outside in the heat of the sun,
the Boyle family re-distributed chunks of planet throughout the car park
for our later enjoyment when we re-emerged to expose our skin to the light.
