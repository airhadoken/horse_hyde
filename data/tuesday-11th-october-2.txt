ON WHEELS:
The studio disappeared on wheels yesterday. The room stands oddly mute.
A piano, a plug board, cases filled with disconnected hard drives. I notice the pattern on the curtains for the first time in a year, strange how we block stuff out.
All those familiar things will re-appear like the live gear in another part of town the sounds we've been working on for months will fill a new room.
In the mean time I thoroughly recommend the new exhibition at the Bernard Jacobson GalleryÂ which I had the privilege of seeing just before it opened. Some breathtaking work by one've my favourite artists.
