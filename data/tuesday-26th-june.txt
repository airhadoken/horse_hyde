WAS THAT YOU?:
Saw my brother stagger from the bench to the bin, carrier bag & can.
Birds were singing, music playing from open windows,
people waiting for buses, cafe's setting tables out on pavements -- life
evolving in the usual fashion. Brother in a bubble, stooped & struggling
to walk, ten years younger than the man I was.
