THE GHOST OF YOU:
I found you smiling back at me like a benevolent Halloween
pumpkinhead. I woke at 4:00am & wrote a long letter to you.
It's how I love you best, you look good too me when I'm sitting
in a favourite room to the far north of Essex. I've seen this view
a million times, but it's more beautiful this morning that I remember.
A tiny piece of the world & all it's children illuminated by golden rays.
A crystal clear sky above our heads & the frost crunching beneath our feet.
Perfect weather for capturing the rich black of long winter shadows.
