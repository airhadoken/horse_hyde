OUT THERE:
Listening to Flowers Forever sing Wet Diamonds watching
the rain again I love it makes me want to stay in & work not moaning
about not getting a tan I turn the lights on to see what I'm doing like
it's supposed to help or something check my notes to see what I'm doing
answering the phone all morning spreading papers out across the floor
full of words that read so nice I want to give up & by a bike ride it round
the island in the rain & soak my brain until it clears.
