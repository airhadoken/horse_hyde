REHEARSING:
Like a cherished car put away for winter, lovingly maintained & nurtured
'till summer the live equipment is ignited at the shed of dreams with
favourite melodies. Grooves that tell the story of long journeys. Hundreds of
thousands of smiles, hands in the air, happy eyes. A journey festooned in good
energy & lined with the faces of friends for life. I'm privileged to work with
the people & to be playing this music to you.
