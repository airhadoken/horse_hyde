GIBBERISHLY YOURS:
So what am I actually doing in this electric window? Is it all just ego,
the ditherings of a lonely idiot, or am I posing behind plate glass in a
notorious Hamburg side show? Don't worry, I'm not going to blub all
over the net & having pondered that thought there's nothing much up
that road today. What I do know it that some days it's the best place
I can find a lyric, when the pen leaves schmaltzy pap on the paper
I check what texts I've sent in the week & what I've written to you
for some direction. It's usually more honest.
Back tomorrow with more new record releases.
