WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL GUSHING:
Some daze it's too early to think grown up thoughts. The poetry collides like
the random cravings of a tempestuous child. I'm remembering a scene from
the Efterklang film "An Island" where they're travelling through a forest singing.
That song, more precisely, that "version" is what makes me want to write music.
I can't find it on the interweb but I know it's out there somewhere.
