WHAT'S THAT SOUND?: 
The rain & the rain & the rain & the rain -- it's beautiful.
Like the woman's voice as she related her tragedies, lifting us
our gathering. A gold cone of fire slipped past on the sodden
street outside followed by the familiar livery of a sponsor's lorry,
an undernourished cheer rose up from the skeleton crowd
lining the road with dripping flags as we were bathed in light
from the sound of her voice.
