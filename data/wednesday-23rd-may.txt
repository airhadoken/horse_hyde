ONLY DREAMING:
A low cloud wrapped around the house that morning, concealing the world
like Brigadoon. Everything that had happened up to that day lay far beyond
the cloud & the world as it had been was nought but phantom.
Then there in a clearing, as sleepers dreamed, dogs of all shapes & sizes
emerged & gathere-ed together to celebrate the sun. Growlers, watchers
& the snappers at heels,  raise-ed themselves as one upon hind legs
with howls of "Hallelujah!" as the rays erupted from the earth & dance-ed
all around in merriment singing,
"Four legs good, Two legs better"
