A PLACE ON THE MAP:
Someone drew an arrow on a stick, it points into an empty field.
The soft heads of something green undulate in waves blown by
a gentle breeze. Broken glass embedded in the dirt beneath my feet
reflects the sky, cars hiss, crows launch themselves from
the blacktop into the wind & tiny England flags fly
