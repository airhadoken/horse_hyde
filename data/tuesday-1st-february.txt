TWO PEOPLE:
"I didn't see you there at first" -- he said, "It's been so long,
I hardly recognised... "
"I come in here to be quiet & work" -- she smiled,
"Are you working?"
"I got a Crisis-Loan" -- he changed his tone through wounded lips
"I was evicted on the weekend. They gave me a months notice
when I was having such a good time."
"Ten years ago I don't know what I was doing. I was going to lot's of parties,
now I'm sat in this cafe talking to you" -- she laughed glancing away
for a second before returning to her book.
