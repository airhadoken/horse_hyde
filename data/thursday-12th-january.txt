The day that started early, suddenly got late. Immersed in
vibrant conversation, at the centre of a hive of industry.
Software updating, machinery tweaking, no making or writing
or painting, but tools returned to the sharpener for re-shaping.
All part of the process of creating -- to the one who misinterpreted
intuitive selection as "copying out've books" or the composer
who thought sampling was theft "making" isn't always
about "making". Listening to by√© lai mar "Ungirthed' at sunset.
Watching clouds turn pink like rosy thugs.
