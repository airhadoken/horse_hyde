FOG FLOATING:
The old Bata Shoe Factory slips out of a luminous fog like a rusting & abandoned ship free-floating mid Atlantic, threatening to topple on tiny vessels. The eye can't see further than fingertips, the wheel is cold between the palms. Black top hisses fast & threatening out've sight.
Too many car crash mornings.
