FOUND IMAGES OF TRANSCENDENCE #1:
Crawling to your house, walking to your house, dancing to your house,
coming home to you. Yesterday's found lyrics that fell from the holes
of telephones find companion in today's, like bookends. Beyond the rain,
the sun sculpts luminous landscapes that undulate & breath --
alive with light.
