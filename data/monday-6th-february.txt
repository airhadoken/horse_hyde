SCRIBBLE TREES:
In a crowded place I heard a man cut loose & shouting sexual innuendoes
make a shrieking woman shriek so hard it sounded fake.
Maybe now he thinks she wants him when secretly she can't stand him --
wants to dump him now I listen hard there's motive in her laughter.
Stringing him along so he keeps thinking he's impressed her.
What's the motive in this cruelty? Now he references the Classics.
And she counters, "Like Europa rides the Bull" until his eyes light up
& now she knows she'll sink him with a little line like, "Bedroom"
when he fakes embarrassment she got him, never noticing that all
the time she's looking for a clean route of escape & smiling.
