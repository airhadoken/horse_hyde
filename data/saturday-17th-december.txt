VILLAGE OF THE GLAMMED:
Paparazzi gather on the corners in between the post box
& the betting shop -- conspicuous in black & looking hungry.
Film stars stagger in from the street acting crazy & enigmatic
- a village of nurtured madness where the famous practice
quirks between takes.
Dali animatronics, slipped down the back of radiators, forgotten
if it's longer than a month, not real until they're back on tele.
I feel safer in Brixton, Romford & Stratford East.
