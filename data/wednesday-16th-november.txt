WHERE HAVE YOU BIN MY BLUE-EYES SON?:
of this diary entry. It's getting dark here in Essex, tomorrow's fog encroaching.
We watch red tail light slips between worlds in the distance as phones
vibrate unanswered in our pockets. Been listening to Moondog curtesy
& M in LA. Listening to Ernst Jandl & the poetry of Dada catching the
colours of oak leaves dancing in the glow of a setting sun.
