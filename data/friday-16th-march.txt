CALLING OUT YOUR NAME: 
On a wonderful day like today when sunlight turns to kiss the
dirt, you capture me in pictures on your cellphone.
This small memento as a token of me crushed amongst the flotsam.
Bobbing with demented buoys in the foam above merciless dark grey
fathom's. I remembered you there, called out your name & lifted up my eyes
in time to see the sunlight kiss the beautiful dirt again, again, again.
