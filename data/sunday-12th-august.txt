PASS THE BATTON:
The joy continues on the radio in the morning, bad news is still
abundant but surrounded by hope & celebration for what's good
about humanity. Broadcasters begin every day with an infectious
enthusiasm for life, talking up beat, generating waves of positivity.
t's no "head-in-the-sand" thing, it's genuine happiness, maybe even
relief that a nation has come together, unified by demonstrations of
determination to do well, legacies of inspiration that lift us all.
Stretching far beyond the tv through thousands of smiling volunteers
we are touched by an energy encouraging us to lift our heads
& pass it on.
All the windows open, listening to "Gabriel" by Roy Davis Jr
