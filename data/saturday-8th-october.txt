FOR WALES:Woke up today with the Arms Park singing full throated strong. Just as it was
when we lived in that brown room in the house by the river between the flea infested flat upstairs & the couple downstair's violent rows. Every morning they played
Walkin to New Orleans on an old gramophone, every day we woke up to brown walls,
but on international weekends we'd turn on the tele, throw open the windows let that angelic singing lift us out've our decay.
Today,Â the Welsh move on, one foot in front of the other -- steady but sure.
