your thin
your thin paper wings
your thin paper wings
in the wind,
dangling
your sun, fly
your window, shattering
your rails

homeless strays,

outside your window
bootleg babies call to you lying among the mosquitos
that summer's fever coming
cats are gathering
outside your window
homeless strays

calling to you
lying among
lie among the mosquitos

talk to me...
there is a sound on the other side of this wall
burning singing on the other side of this glass
footsteps concealed
silence is preserving the voice
walking in the wind at the water's edge
comes close to covering my rubber feet
listening to the barbed wire hanging
there is a sound on the other side of this wall
burning singing on the other side of this glass
footsteps concealed
silence is preserving the voice
silver chain
thrown away
broken wing
silver and blue and blue and denim
and silver and red and silver and red
and blue and yellow and white and blue
and blue and red and grey and red and 
green and blue and yellow and black and
black and red and green and white and blue
(and blue)
and grey and blue and white and yellow
and black and white and blue
(and blue)
and red and white and red and grey
and grey and red and red and yellow and
green and grey and blue and blue and grey
