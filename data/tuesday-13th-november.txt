PAINTING BY NUMBERS:
Pinks & Blues thin as bone china hang luminous on the horizon.
Trees blush, browns turn pink, yellows vibrate & Autumn
oscillates for a fleeting moment. You're too busy to notice,
always rushing around, jobs to do -- busy, busy. You rack up
lists of hard facts, tick them off, pile them up between us.
If I didn't know better I'd say you were repulsed by romance.
