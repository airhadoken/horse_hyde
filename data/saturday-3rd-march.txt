LAST NIGHT I DREAMED A DOG:
The graphic images are going to be transmitting sounds specific to you,
so it's the crack in the wall that interests me. Sounds like hemp rope twisting -- like the creaking of wood & ropes on a tall ship. Not the sounds of decay, but the sound of  inanimate objects that have, through soaking up the energy of being in constant motion, evolved into living things.
