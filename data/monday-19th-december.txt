One've those daze that started out so great yet with an almost imperceptible
undercurrent of erosion. As the sky turned the colour of grey milk, rain
began to permeate our clothes & cling to us like mould in mists & drizzles,
I started getting phone calls, friends with car crash heads warning
storms up the road. It's too easy to conclude that everything's a struggle,
exciting to tune into a different broadcast that electrifies foot fall &
encourages a grin. Make a List, Get on with it, tick things off.
