TURN THE LIGHT ON SOMEBODY:
At dawn the clouds move fast & low over the green & pleasant. A buzzard hangs in the wind above the long grass shopping for fast food. A few leaves still cling to the branches of naked trees like random notes on twisted staves & for an hour the clouds break to let the sun dance.
