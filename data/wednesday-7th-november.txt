SOUTHERN CROSS:
A beautiful day in the fields under skies almost as big as Texas. New friends
meet to listen to new things, hit things, eat things. New friends drive from
Brixton to Essex, like a memory of a sleepless driver at the wheel of a new
Mercedes, doing pick-ups at 3:00am, navigating with two conflicting
sat-navs. Today birds hover over long grass turning rich shades of grey
like a camel's pelt blowing in a chill breeze that lifts  the spirit. I want
to sing & show you how I feel.
