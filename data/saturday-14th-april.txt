ANOTHER FOUND OBJECT:
Found a collection of Leadbelly manuscripts in the window
of the charity shop, next to the curry house.
It was black & brown & torn & printed beautifully like you don't often
see books printed so lovingly in the 2000's. "The Leadbelly Legend"
(revised & Augmented Edition -1965) & on the cover, the price, $2.50.
A book a long way from home, that I couldn't walk past or leave
to fade in the sun for Â£1.99.
