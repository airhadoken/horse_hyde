Here's my best interpretation:
Is that you is that
Is that really you?
to crawl between my lips?
Two kangaroo fingers push
through and scratch my back in rhythm.
Slow foot ! Slow fast !
Waiting for a night to wrap around us !
I could go in there... get some sweet stuff.
:All these things, in me, in me:
Is that you is that
Is that really you?
to hone beneath my skin?
Two numbers click between
my touch
when you pull me down into the
Rising ! Rising !
Room on the inside of a glass eye beating !
Calling me in there... get that sweet stuff.
:All these things, in me, in me:
(did you come in down the stairs?)
Is that you is that
Is that really you?
to crawl between my lips?
Two kangaroo fingers push
through and scratch my back in rhythm.
Slow foot ! Slow fast !
Waiting for a night to wrap around us !
I could go in there... get some sweet stuff.
:All these things, in me:
