SPARE PARTS:
A gathering of broken folk ended the evening laughing, waving to one another
luminous in the yellow glow of a car park light. Dirty cars, wait between
the lines for us, animals & fossil fuelled familiars  privy private
rants spilled out from that chaotic space between the ears.
Billions of broken moments on the move.
Turn on the radio, tune between the stations,
there's a gentle rhythm in the noise.
