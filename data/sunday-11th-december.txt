MISSING IN ACTION:
And we'll miss it dearly until after the Oympics.
The dancing shoes won't go back on fast enough then!
Thank you to everyone who celebrated with us in Holland last night.
Your energy was electric, lifting us out've illness & winter blues
to dance & laugh together in that extraordinary way that only happens
at dance parties.
Have a great Winter, Spring & Summer.
