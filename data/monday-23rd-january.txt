FRIENDLY FEARS:
"It's quite tight round yours" -- she said, "especially dustbin day"
"I need to start driving again" -- the other replied in a voice that
betrayed her timid fear. "It's 'cause I never did for so long"
"It all comes back -- do it, just do it!" -- the first one countered
with free a gift of enthusiastic fear-swerve.
"You're a "spark" " -- she continued, "Just get in the car & drive"
