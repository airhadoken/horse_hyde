AND THE PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD:
The formerly discarded & broken, the outcasts & retches of society,
gathered in a small sunlit room behind the busy shopping mal.
As each caught the other's eye they smiled & nodded. Some stood
& crossed to shake hands, hands rock steady, no longer shaking,
clothes clean & eyes bright. Some offered refreshments, some offered
numbers, to visitors, new faces peered in & asked,
"Am I in the right place?"
Then they spoke gentle of dark & brutal journeys,
but when they got to the part where they found this room they
would all light up & smile,
"... I was welcomed in with love"
