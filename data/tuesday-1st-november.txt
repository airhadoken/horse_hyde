Missed the Alberto Burri exhibition here in town, would like to have seen it,
though we visited his galleries in the old tobacco warehouses a few years ago
& I can't imagine anything topping that. I like his work a lot though & always
keen to see it in the flesh. The gig last night was such fun, we even remembered
how to play, such a laugh, such joy, yeah I like this city & being in this band a lot.
Got some good friends here in Turin, people who always look after us. You should
come visit, there's a lot've cool stuff going on here. Now we head for the sky hole,
the one that pops out over Essex. Take me home country road ha ha ha.
