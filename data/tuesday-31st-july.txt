TINY ACTS OF PUBLIC ART:
TINY ACTS OF PUBLIC ART:
I found your heart drawn in the dust with speed marks like it was
a fast one -- are you waiting for the street car? -- or just hoping for
a friend? Though we didn't meet I thought I recognised your hand
you left your mark all over town. It wasn't 'til I looked again the
photograph revealed the marks laid down before left your heart
came clear. Was bear or something monstrous or was it  just
parallel love? & did you ever catch that street car, are you still
waiting for a friend?
