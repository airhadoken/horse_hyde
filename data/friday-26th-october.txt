HEAVENLY CHIMES:
Driving yesterday I was lifted by the sound of the Danish National Symphony
Orchestra & the Danish National Choir preforming Brahms German Requiem
& now, surrounded by the vibrant colours of Autumn I'm listening to
1982 + BJ Cole, (how great would it be to play with BJ Cole!?) following a trail
back to the stage.
