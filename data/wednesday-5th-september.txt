TWO METAL SHUFFLE:
The rails were good, delivering me into paths of friends
I hadn't see for a life time. Smiles & hands extended in genuine
happiness at meeting. The one that was traveling to Geneva to play
the blues in a gallery -- you kick started domino smiles linked
by that amazing army of volunteers spilling out from East London
to permeate the mood of the city with goodvibes ,
raising us to be a community.
