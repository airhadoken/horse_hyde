HUMMIN' & HOLLERIN':
These eggs are doing what eggs will always do, -
talking incessantly over one another. They sound like a classroom
of noisy kids or a tube carriage full of excited tourists. Whilst the colour
Yellow, on the other hand, is humming the way the cables of the
National Grid hum when you stand under them -- vaguely menacing.
