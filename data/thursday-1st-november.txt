HELLO WEEN:
Last night the streets erupted with dunk zombies & devils, Jocks in dresses
with death clown faces herding girls with legs up to the limits of imagination
down roads strewn with broken glass. Queueing in shirt sleeves, three deep,
in a freezing wind. Dazed & tired eyes, but hanging on, expectant of something
amazing. The bones of legend are exposed, damp scattered between
closing time & the Garden of Earthly delights.
