THE BOTTLE & THE TRAFFIC CONE:
Just another night out like all the others -- starting innocent,
somehow always waking in another car park. 
CDJ plays the excellent "Golden Rhythm/Ink Music" -- by Volcano the Bear.
Suits the temperament tonight -- a different underscore for the other
radio wave surfer between the ears.
