IN SHORT:
Sorry about the delay in getting this to you immersed in a writing
state flowing threads, but every time I drive this comes on the stereo,
which reminds me of a night in the basement of radio 1 playing Beefheart
with a bottle & a friend, soundtracked by
"My Head is my Only House Unless it Rains"- do you know what I mean?
