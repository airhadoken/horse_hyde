The mad & the damned gathered with the crazy & the misfits in the garish light  of anonymous rooms, sipping crude tea from polystyrene cups & laughing.  Laughter knocked them over like skittles, lifted them up like they were  children surfing tidal waves of pure joy. The happiness they felt separated  them from years of pain & self obsession & looking one to another they were  filled with love & compassion.
