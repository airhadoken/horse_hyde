WIFFIN' AUTUMN:
Sleepless & I'm shaking, this is a beautiful morning if only
I could touch it. Today we're opalescent, caught in the cold light,
sleepless in the underground. Breathing your breath, driving at night
through the back waters of southern Essex. Home, but not alone, radio on.
Listening to the Foundations like a school boy in Mom's kitchen.
