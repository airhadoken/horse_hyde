anatano yume ni watashi wo tamoteru
- can you hold me in your dreams?
watashi wo kanjiru koto ga dekiruno
watashi ga anata wo kanjiru youni
- can you feel me like I feel you?
goodbye, mother earth...
can you feel me like i feel you?
i don't want to kill time
i want it to live
i'm not wasting this life
i'm living it in
you just rip off the planet
and take what you want
i'm coming to get you
if you don't give up
a beautiful destination
what's it's worth
a beautiful destination
goodbye, mother earth
i am all that surrounds you
the earth and the sky
you
you're the mouth and the money
that's bleeding me dry
why
i hear the spirit of the world
goodbye, mother earth
kocchi da!
it's a beautiful destination
kocchi da!
for what it's worth
kocchi da!
it's a beautiful destination
kocchi da!
goodbye, mother earth
it's a beautiful destination
for what it's worth
it's a beautiful destination
goodbye, mother earth
