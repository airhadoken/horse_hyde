THE RETURN OF RED LIGHT RETURNS:
There's a flood in the kitchen, but I don't mind. A crude little painting
on the wall called, "Johnny Cash in Heaven" I almost want to buy.
Andrew Bird on someone's stereo in passing. Underscoring the
morning with carefree whistling. I try to buy it, but the record shop
was out, it must be a sign & get back on the street. I look for
somewhere secret for you to find me & the sunlight bouncing
off the buildings is fabulous, life affirming, delivering hope.
