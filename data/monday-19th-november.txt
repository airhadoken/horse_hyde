On Friday, following cake & light in Soho, I got inspired for the first time
in years to paint on canvas after seeing some fabulous paintings from 1964
by the artist Mark Vaux. Every time I visit that gallery something new
happens. Cork Street looked vibrant & fabulous like a street of toy shops
at Christmas, my favourite street of galleries anywhere in the world,
it would be a tragedy to loose it.
