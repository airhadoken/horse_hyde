I found this fat rock lying in a field emitting a purring sound
& beneath that a low breathing, as if asleep. The grass around it made
that usual low level random hissing & chattering. The vague shadow
off to the right was unusually silent -- I gave it a wide berth.
Driving in the dark, Radio playing: "Raynardine" -- Fairport Convention.
