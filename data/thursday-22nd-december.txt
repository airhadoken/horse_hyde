Into the holes beneath the City of Dreams we dive, breathing the
dust of skin & crumbling buildings. An urban tribe wired up to tiny
electronic friends, distractions from the wonderful imagery
tumbling all around us. Apart form the free papers it's becoming
increasingly rare to see books in commuter's hands. Couples huddle
together, a single white cable connecting them, squinting & laughing
into their hands. Mothers hunch over miniature screens with frantic
thumbs & children leave home young via shrunken worlds held between
their eager little fingers. Everywhere around us the dance & poetry of a
vibrant world is rich, exciting & free.
