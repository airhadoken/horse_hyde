THE RETURN OF CAMERA:
A forgotten memory found in a lost camera, of a hotel room
above the casino in a town of extraordinary windows where
the only working Roman lighthouse in the world stands with
it's feet in the raging waters of the Atlantic.
Today the birds dive out've hedgerows at the tires of passing cars
in seemingly desperate attempt to find something unearthed
in the seconds that the rubber rolls across the glistening black top.
What are they looking for thats worth risking their lives?
Yesterday, in the post, the second edition of "An Antidote to Indifference"
by the excellent Caught By The River.
