"CORR!":
A slow black shape moved across the sky, caught from the corner
of a sleepy eye. Moved so slow I could've looked but I didn't want
to get drawn in. Focused on something positive instead, the morning
meditation on the edge of the bed. Infinite blue gift of something good,
wrapped around us like a friend. As the black thing left my line of vision
it went "Corr!", like it was mocking.
Yeah, that's all it was -- just the ghost of a memory.
