your rails your thin your thin paper wings
your thin paper wings
in the wind dangling
your sun fly right your window shattering
the wind your coca-cola sign rattling rattling
sugarbox sugarboy handheld candle sugarboy

your rails your thin your thin paper wings
your thin paper wings in the wind dangling
your sun fly right your window shattering
the wind your coca-cola sign rattling rattling
resonator resonator resonator resonator

homeless strays gathering outside your window
bootleg babies call to you
lying amongst the mosquitoes
this summer fever's coming
cats are gathering outside your window
bootleg babies call to you
lying amongst the mosquitoes
your rails your thin your thin paper wings
in the wind your sun fly right rattling rattling
your window shattering the wind
shining on your coca-cola sign
your rails your thin your thin paper wings
there is a sound on the other side of this wall
a burning singing on the other side of this glass
footsteps concealed
silence is returning a voice
walking in the wind at the water's edge
comes closer covering my rubber feet
listening to the barbed wire, hanging
walking in the wind at the water's edge
come closer covering my rubber feet
listening to the barbed wire, hanging
there is a sound on the other side of this glass!
a burning singing on the other side of this glass!
footsteps! concealed! silence is returning a voice!
you should not walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should walk away!
when you walk away!
you should remember!
