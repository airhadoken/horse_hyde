A LATE ENTRY:
A day connected by wires & phones, awash with creative juice,
interspersed with bizarre violence of such magnitude that it transcended
normality, manifesting it's self as fleshy cartoons.
There's been a lot've strange destruction of late, some out've characters.
Curve-balls from people I trusted & called friend. Perhaps it was just
Venus in her crossing, pulling at the head strings of men & women.
I watched them turning as if they were but salty swell to dash themselves
in full moon frenzy on the rocks of their own worst fears.
A heart, once broken, never mends, it grows a scar.
