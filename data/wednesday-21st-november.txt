THIS TRAIN BOUND FOR GLORY:
Dark rain, cold light, the sky comes down to the ground to run
it's sodden fingers through the trees. The trees recede in tones of
blue & yellow light promises nostalgia & sanctuary from the windows
of houses before dawn. This was the habitat of the duvet diver, a face at
the window looking out at the world, a cold winter flat in the eaves of a
Bute-town building where mushrooms grew on the kitchen walls.
