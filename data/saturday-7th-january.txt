Alone in a kitchen in the quiet time before sunrise lights drift out've the sky
like stars with wings. Enough time to reply to friends whose mail has waited,
time to sit & read & meditate. The clock ticks, the wind whispers through
air bricks, the house breaths. A clear space between the ears & in the
space around them. Books & records arrive in the post daily to feed a hunger
for knowledge & stimulation. in tandem with this, the need for contact &
communication -- the exchange of ideas & experiences remains undiminished,
crucial food to sustain us on our journey.
