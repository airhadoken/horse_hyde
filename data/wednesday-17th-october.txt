PULL YOU HEAVY BUT BEAUTIFUL:
Sanctuary beneath the sheets as heavy rain drummed on the roof &
the wind got crazy in the trees. Alarm clocks were kind to us this morning,
waiting longer than we expected to start their bleating. Now windows are
peppered in rain drops & the sun transforms them into platinum notes on a
glass manuscript. The rhythm of their running & the gaps between.
The breathing of the wind through air vents in the walls of the house & the
steady purr of a lap top on the kitchen table.
Something beautiful slips into Essex from Los Angeles as the sun makes
the day look inviting -- who am I to argue?
