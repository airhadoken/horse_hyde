LAST NIGHT IN TURIN:
Lovers kissed beneath the image of a smiling giant, his hand buried deep in the mouth of a soft toy crocodile. Couples kiss inside transparent umbrellas, slow-walking between grotesquely opulent shop displays. The lure of neon, the aroma of night coffee. Outside the chapel of St John, where years of urine has stained the pavement, lovers flash, capturing memories of one another as single men look for friends in brightly lit bars. Outside in the tourist squares Lovers walk tiny dogs, dress them in expensive tiny overcoats & body swerve beggar women clutching brightly coloured cups. Naked stone giants recline alone in back streets, warm dust blows up through grills from underground carparks & everywhere I walk I'm watched by the eyes of marble gargoyles. I love this city.
