WHEN THE BODY IS AN ALIEN:
Flu flies fierce in the face of fortune. However, with the appropriate state of
mind the cavalcade of compositions never falters, nor languishes in the long face
lane. Press gearing up for this week's announcements. Phone lines humming
hot between Essex & the world. My head is miles away on the fringes of the
Emerald City where the poetry & imagery vibrate, transmitting energy
to those bereft of inspiration. The cultural centres of our nation aren't always
in the galleries, libraries & museums -- "that guitar solo" on my mind.
