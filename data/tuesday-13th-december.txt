EVERYTHING IS CARBON:
I'm thinking about charcoal twisting between the fingers,
describing violent arks across the surface of heavy paper.
I'm thinking about beach fires on summer nights & finding
rings of carbonised wood at sunrise. This morning in the dark
I played the score to "Silent Running" by 65 Days of Static
& watched the sky turn blue.
