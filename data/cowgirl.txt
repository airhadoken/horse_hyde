i'm invisible...
and a razor of love...
why doncha call me? i feel like flying in too...
i'm invisible...
and a razor of love...
why doncha call me? i feel like flying in too...
and a razor of love...
i scream 
i scream 
i scream so much
you know what i mean
this electric stream
and my tears 
interleave with the wires and energy
and my machine
this is my beautiful dream
i'm-a
hurting no one
hurting no one
hurting no one
hurting no one
i wanna give you everything
you energy
a good thing
you everything
everythingeverythingeverythingeverything...
one final scream 	of love
who couldn't climb 	this high
she looks beautiful 	like a child
a fuel of tears
and i wanna scream 	you know what i mean
this is hurting no one
and a razor of love
why doncha call me? i feel like flying in too...
and a razor of love...
