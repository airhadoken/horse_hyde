EXACTLY WHERE?:
Everybody's flying to have fun in the snow. See the lonely boys alone,
let loose in a world gone cold. Found a cafe with some sad-boy
singing nothing I could understand -- everybody talking tongues.
This place was notorious, vibrating with hormonal conversation.
Now there's only a waitress cleaning spoons, watching me, suspicious.
If I'd know you were on your own I would've caught a fast train
into town to hear the world through your ears -- we could pool our dreams,
but as it is I'm here, exactly where I'm meant to be... it seems.
