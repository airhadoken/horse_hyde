INNOCENCE:
Innocence sits in the sun, oblivious to corrosion dancing in the distance.
Ever nearer, ever more voracious, it's insatiable appetite quelled momentarily
by cataclysmic disaster. Then only to rest until it's headlong impulse for
destruction be inevitably resumed. So what of those whose innocence sits
in the sun? We continue to protect as best we understand whilst fitting them
with road maps for their treacherous journeys.
