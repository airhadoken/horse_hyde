FOCUS:
Though the news in print & on the radio has reverted to it's old focus
on what's going wrong in the world. Small pockets of positivity
evolve in local shops & cafes. People are smiling at one another,
helping each other, phoning up & offering support. Even the drunks in
the park are gathering to help one another, talking with
renewed enthusiasm, a spark of light at the back of the eye.
Listening to MT sing, "Paranoid People Meet me in the Middle"
