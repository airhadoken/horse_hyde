DANCING IN THE LIGHT:
A bright sun burns the frost off the cars & you could see for miles
if you were here. Long shadows raise shallow furrows in the fields
& Autumn clings to dancing sticks. I know it's not new but I was listening
to John Grant last night. Never knew his story or his work but when he
stepped out onto the Barbican stage the night we went to see Efterklang
all that changed.
