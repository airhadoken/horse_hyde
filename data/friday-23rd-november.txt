EVERYTHING IS DIRT & ALL THE DIRT IS BEAUTIFUL: 
I found beautiful concrete structures underneath the fly-overs
at Brent Cross. A river, sheathed in hardcore shuttering lined with
delicate trees that reminded me of Tokyo, tableaux framed in cracks & rust
whose stains dibble fabulous colours down the walls of stinking gullies.
