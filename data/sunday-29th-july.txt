THE WORLD OF TINY EVENTS:
Seen only by a handful perhaps, this sculpture crafted by outsider lips.
Left on a stone self outside Bromley Tube station for those who wait for
lifts or addicts drawn to the shade of a huge horse chestnut tree.
It won't make the Tate, it won't make television, nor play to thousands,
but on my travels I found it beautiful.
