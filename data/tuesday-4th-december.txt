VENUS:
Venus waits for me before the dawn, where pink turns blue.
All other stars run & hide, but Venus waits unflinching
in her duty dressed in radiant light.
Down at the crossroads every morning a dark hand extends to shake,
offering a welcome ride but Venus waits when other stars desert, to tip
the balance & set me walking towards the sun.  
(Listening to Letka in a break between)
