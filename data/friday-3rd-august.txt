BETWEEN THE STEELY TWINS:
Stuck on the night train nothing moving someone went under the wheels
further up the line, somebody not going to see the sunrise. On the pavement
back in town a tattooed boy sits cross legged holding court with a a group of
mesmerised girls gathered round him sipping light beers from the bottle.
It's warm, we wear our shirts open, savouring the smell of slow time.
Back on the train a young actress finds a seat near a family away from
inquisitive drunk boys & asks, "Do you know why we're not moving?"
