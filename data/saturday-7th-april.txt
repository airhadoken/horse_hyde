HAVE WE MET?:
The night smelled wet & green as they stepped out've the car.
Three pairs of feet crunched on gravel. Ignoring the shapes that curled
in the air & danced from their limbs, they moved towards the light of
the pink house. This was no casual arrival, an invitation long avoided,
finally accepted, decades overdue. They were surprised to find their arrival
this eagerly awaited with genuine warmth by a family whose faces,
so familiar it almost broke your heart again to look. Friends gathered
round a kitchen table all stood, came to the door as one. A room filled
like a shrine with radio transmissions, arms flung wide to greet with
smiling eyes. Safe harbour, on such a lonely night, a place long imagined
through bedsit years. Following a beacon in the dark, a radio & the sound of
his voice.
