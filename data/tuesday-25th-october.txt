YOUR DIRTY MOUTH:
Rode the train into the city with a plum-voiced blonde who tried to talk trashyslipping badly practiced expletives into her stories about her favourite alleysÂ & nights on the lash. The whole carriage visibly winced when she saidshe blew a shed load on last night's booze but it didn't matter cause shecould afford it. Two old geezers across the aisle eyed her & smiled.Both on a day out up town dressed in No Fear caps emblazoned withdiamante encrusted flying skulls & Brooklyn hoodies. They left the trainon Zimmer frames, bright-eyed, clean & driven. The blonde fell out ina mess of hair, spraying obscenities like a toddler learns to walk,"I haven't changed, I feel so dirty" she staggered to her admiring audience.
