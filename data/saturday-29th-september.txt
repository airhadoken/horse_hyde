SALVADOR DALI:
Watching IP Man in a Spanish hotel room-service installation
with rain lashing city buildings like a scene from My Fair Lady.
Everyone is uptown tapas hunting, re-united by food & tomorrow's
groove, whilst the Primal's transmit their poetry to sodden thousands.
Wish I could join them, but a night of meditation beckons.
