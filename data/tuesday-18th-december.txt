WHO STOLE THE STEPS?:
A curious curve-ball day of phone call queues & changing plans that conspire
to blow a fuse or inspire complaints. This isn't the day I ordered, but it's the
one grinning up at me from the mat. Time to practice acceptance,  change,
learn to roll with it, embrace the unexpected, find something new in the
unwanted.
A warehouse becomes a cupboard, a dark room grows windows. Learning how
to laugh when the lemmings leap into your path  -- there's the trick!
Reward in the sound of your laughter when things don't go our way & who
says my plans are the cat's cream anyway? -- who stole the steps at Aislies?
