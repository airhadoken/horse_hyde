SATELITE OF LOVE:
Yesterday in a Blue Square imitation of a Le Corbusier nightmare I met the woman
who made the best coffee in town. A dormitory satellite envisioned by planners
back in the 50's to raise the spirits of aspiring populations. Over time it lost
it's way & not even the poetic curves of Henry Moore's bio-morphic humanoids
dotted about the precinct can redress the despair peculating within this crumbling
specimen jar.
