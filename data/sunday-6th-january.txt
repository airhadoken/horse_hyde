WE ARE BRIGADOONED: 
As we wake in gentle blue light the moon grins at us on it's side
before a fog envelopes us, low hiss of traffic in the distance,
invisible. A mantle between us & the sun, once again the smell of
mud. Spring is keen, new life already on the move. I've been
trawling the web through the night for images from the rim of
the city, punishing myself with coffee to inspire a title, focus
the story that's dancing in my head. The story, like it's title,
is lying somewhere out there between the cracks where all my
favourite poetry waits -- If it was easy they'd all be doing it. 
Efterklang's new film is released today -- sadly missed the preview
because the mud & all it's succulent friends.
