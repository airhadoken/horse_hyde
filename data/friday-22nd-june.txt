FORGOT YOUR NAME:
Tying your hair back in clouds of violent perfume on an underground train.
The magic trick you perform daily rocking yet so delicately drawing
charcoal rings around your eyes, holding a tiny mirror, surrounded by
strangers. In the city we get numb to crowds, the proximity of people
we don't know, like wall paper, is nothing too embarrassing?
