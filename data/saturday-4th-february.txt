DO THAT:
What's that music? -- a familiar instrumental plays on the radio
as I walk into the room. It's something seminal to change the world,
start an Empire, under-score a.n.other classic film.
The room fills with the howl of woman. She howls like she's oblivious
to the world. Her laughter makes everyone look round angry, uncomfortable,
glancing silently. Secretly we'd give anything to be as spontaneous as her,
but this is England
& we don't do that here.
