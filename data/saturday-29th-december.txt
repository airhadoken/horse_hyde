STREET THEATRE:
Watched an old oak frozen in the stance of it's last dance
like a Shinjuku grotesque from a Daido Moriyama photograph --
street dancers staggering between traffic in black & white.
Wandered around in the dark at 2:00am searching for sleep.
Typed letters to friends where it was still yesterday & nearly
tomorrow. Found a quiet place away the taunts of sleepers
breathing rhythms, made a nest of blankets & a rendezvous
with exhausting dreams.
