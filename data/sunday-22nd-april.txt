HOW TO DRAW A NOTHING:
Crows sing chorus to an empty sky, save for bruises full of rain.
They cling to the horizon & pass us by to drop their load on
secret locations. Clear blue, the colour of hope, breaks
between them & light reflects from their glorious cotton heads
who's curves dare pencils to dream of dancing...
