FIRST CHORD OF THE DAY:
Watching Andy Goldsworthy build stone seeds, ice snakes & cocoons
of driftwood is a meditation. Weights lift, pressure drops & a dialogue
with the rhythm of the earth resumes. A smile, a forgotten gift,
a voice heard since birth all wave in at the window  when he says,
"Art for me is a form of nourishment"
