Whose shadow falls across this morning? Whose thoughts worm in
to steer the thinking? What time is this that waits between seconds
stealing happiness? These shadows only cast by sun, a light that shines
for us to see. These thoughts will ever try to bind us, grind us if we
to believe. And time is nothing but clay, waiting for the wheel , the potter's
fingers shape it, make it beautiful & real.
