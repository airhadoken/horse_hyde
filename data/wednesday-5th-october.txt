APP-OLOGY FROM THE HOUSE OF HYDE:
Late again with today's diary, got into the studio early, head down, phone off,
internet locked-out, but took a break to clear the ears, sit in the wind & read
A Bigger Messag. The man has the enthusiasm & curiosity of a three year old!
Deeply inspiring -- someone I'd love to meet please.
