BREATHING:
It's unusually still outside beyond that loud jazz coming from
the kitchen -- something trad with a Christmas flavour, prolongs
a cosy feeling of cocoon where we all floated smiling,
"This is a great day, thank you".
Today I got goosebumps in another room, listening to
 James "Blood" Ulmer. Cherishing the quiet of a phone-less morning
when even the electric pipe stops flooding time with mail.
Where loaded words lie motionless like greyhounds waiting for the gun
& the images that dance across the backs of eyes are simple,
don't collide or crash or screech or howl.
Clear direction in a low & modest voice is all they give today,
in the amnesty between years,
like plants quietly replenishing the world with oxygen.
