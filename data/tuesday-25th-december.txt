PEAS ON EARTH:
The banquet is set upon the table, all guests are gathered round,
expectation on each face with radiant smiles beneath paper hats
& joyous laughter the festival of exquisite culinary delights returns
to town.
The Radio plays Bing & Andy, Slade & Wizard, but today I find
a different space in Mosckus.
