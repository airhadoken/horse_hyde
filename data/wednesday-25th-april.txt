TODAY I MET A MAN:
Driving home last night I caught sight of a flailing peach skinned man
standing at the side of the road. He was one've those characters who isn't
there but crops up when you're tired, like the giant striped octopus
that languishes in the bushes in the middle of the afternoon, sunning
it's self on dangerous bends. These creatures always appear at roadside.
Perhaps they live solely to distract weary motorists into driving
their vehicles through hedges. The peach skinned man is the latest
recruit to the legion of waving crazies, more subtle than his companions
& perhaps even a little sinister.
