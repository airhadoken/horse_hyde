DAY TWO OF ANOTHER END OF THE WORLD:
A north London taxi exposed it's self to me discretely, dressed as
a bumble bee, concealing it's identity beneath a blue plastic mac,
preserving it's modesty A warehouse full of artists & musicians greeted
me with serious coffee & improvised cinemas. Nests of exotic guitar pedals
spilled out from beneath radiators, tiny Parisian dogs played keyboards
& drummers shook my hand with fists like sandpaper steel.
I've meet some extraordinary people, gifted musicians, talented artists,
enthusiastic, hard working & all of them friendly. People I never knew
existed until I slipped outside the castle gates  & waved.
