HAPPY BIRTHDAY:
Claire Grogan dances off the flickering celluloid surface of Gregory's Girl
to stand alone on a stark platform at Bury St Edmunds, crowded for one
time only with famous faces, all wearing the same expression of stunned
disbelief,  on the day we came to give thanks & bid farewell to Master
Broadcaster John Peel. She made our hearts flutter that day, as she
always did & always will -- an apparition from the far side of the silver
screen, a momentary visitor to the dimension of schoolboy dreams.
For the first time since the day we caught trains in opposite directions
she returns to celebrate the rising sun.
