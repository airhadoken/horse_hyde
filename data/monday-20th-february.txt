When the music makes you feel good follow
to the source of a river born out've light.
Scooped up in cupped & trembling hands
to drink it's song through lips
parched by long & arduous journeys
on which we built a faith of troubles
that made us forget such beauty is real. 
(CDJ plays something new from Erland Dahlen)
