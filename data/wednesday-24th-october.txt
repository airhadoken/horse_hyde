Out've the fog I see Paul Nash's trees appear & a marker someone's
stuck in the ground when I wasn't looking -- a stick with a white strip
of plastic blowing in the breeze, then another & another & a field full
of sticks with strips of white tattered plastic blowing in the breeze.
I saw this in my head years ago, perhaps it couldn't wait any longer
& made it's self ?
