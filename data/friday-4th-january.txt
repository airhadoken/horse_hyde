IN PASSING:
Found another shrine by the side of the road, two small bunches of flowers.
What's the story? All these lives, all these memories, journeys touching other
lives. Joy, Laughter, aguish, pain, extraordinary fragments gathered by one
individual, assembling a vision, a point of view -- Experience, information &
advice, replaced by silence. The journey of one life lived, remembered in the
rain beneath a dry stone wall hung with ivy. Woke up this morning & found
your mail, the sadness & relief -- sail on brother.
