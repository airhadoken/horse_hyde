BALL:
We sat out side in the cool evening air naming stars through apps on our iPhones.
The moon was huge & low in the sky, a delicate red crescent airbrushed on the horizon -
alluding to something spherical, Massive & threatening. Jumping into the car we followed
a white broken line to where it could bee seen slipping out into space. Foot prints√Ç preserved
in dust, cartoon calling cards left by something small & deadly. We watched in black & white, wrapped in blankets, brushing sleep from our eyes -- nations of electrified school boys learning heavy into TVs like TT racers -- our dreams come real -- the fantastic became possible.
