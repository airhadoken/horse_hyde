I'M MELTING:
Lively Up Yourself, Babylon By Bus, hungry to go live.
Locked in a small room for weeks learning how to do things
that came natural to a 14 year old looping the same parts,
going groove blind & trying to sing at the same time.
The trick is to train the fingers to think for themselves
then you can nurse that self centred voice. The comfort of
familiar safety nets is slipped out from underneath, the
evolution of beautiful things, the journey set to music
& words -- don't get caught in a roadblock.
