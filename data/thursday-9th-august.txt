LIGHT UP:
The smiles on the trains pervade that regular grey-ness of mood.
If this continues, commuting could be fun. Strange costumes
proliferate - union jack dresses & waste coats --  a cavalcade of red,
white & blue. Late night station platforms watched over by beaming
pink vested volunteers waiting to guide us on our way, alleviate our
fears. The pressure lifts & the impossible seems just a trick of the mind.
