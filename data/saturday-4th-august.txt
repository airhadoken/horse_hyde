21ST CENTURY ICONS #1:
Sat beneath Elizabeth Frink's horse-n-jockey drinking coffee in the sun
we topped up tans in the name of art & chicken wraps. The bus-boy
cleared tables with heavily tattooed arms intoning in a low moan
this was his first day back off holiday. The accent was a long way from
here but you could feel his road stretch out to infinity & as he made
a clearing amongst the cheese & pickle depositing small but heavy
moods for us to carry back into the city.
