HEADS OF THE VALLEY: 
When we woke up this morning, Essex looked like the Heads of the Valley
driving from Ebbw Vale to Merthyr. Small grey wooly sculptures revealed
feeding on curb side grass. The sculptures here are the elephantine
carcasses of Oak & Ash, magnified as silhouettes, emerge from out a pale
sun, flutter past like mute whistles brushed from our lips with a fast hand.
The Head's of the Valley, where we used to drive every Friday night,
evoked now on an Essex morning, leaving the flat lands of the East
to catch rails into cities or leaving the lights of Cardiff behind to climb
into the stars.
