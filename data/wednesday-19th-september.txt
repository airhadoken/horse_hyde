Memories in the back yard with a musician who seen it & done it,
packed his bags & moved to a Caribbean Island, Played with all them stars,
moved amongst the rich n famous, laid down a cool groove for music you & me
grew up on -- the roots & even literally the loops at the heart of contemporary
music for the last twenty years or more. Found peace of mind & happiness
jamming in a bar with good food n company. Joyous faces come to dance &
celebrate. With enough to live on & soul food a-plenty cut loose from the
clamour for fame & shiny shiny shinys. The riches at the root of Music & art
have nothing to do with material wealth or the transient cult of celebrity.
