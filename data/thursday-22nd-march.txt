SHADOW PLAY:
Favourite trees dress themselves in Spring, Fat bees inspect the world,
to see how well we tended it in their absence. The clouds are
gossamer curtains fluttering in a gentle wind, filtering the morning sun.
And that unfamiliar heat on your skin is a promise kept for the return
of Summer.
