TURNING A LIGHT ON:
Day 8: ran out've of dongle bandwidth, ran out've patience, ran out & boughta dongle I could call my own, got hooked up -- hallelujah! This is starting to soundÂ likeÂ a proper BLOG eh? -- the minutiae of a citizen's day ha ha! Naa, think I'lltake sustenance from the sunrise, get back to work & enjoy the day.(p.s. -- short rehearsal to remind us how to play in preparation for Turin)
