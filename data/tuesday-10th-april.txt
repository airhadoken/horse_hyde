ON THE ROAD AGAIN:
The Zebra lies down in the road. The tourists dance across it's back.
They wait for the traffic to subside to strike a legendary pose.
Embarrassed giggles, beaming grins, the faces of the pilgrims
tell the stories of a life's ambition.Red tail lights flicker,
motorists hunch over wheels impatient as the seasonal trickle down
of all those great songs queues at curb side, taking turns at being
Gilbert or George, John, Paul or Gringo.
