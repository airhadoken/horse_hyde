A NEW THRONE:
I see you're out & riding trains again with that new glint in your eye
where once you carried pain but now cut free from ego's cunning whisper
you enjoy the simple groove. Was it you I remembered caught
in reflections or just a shadow cast by the sun? Who's voice is this from
out your lips I'd long forgot could smile? See you sat across the aisle,
I watch you gently rock to a westbound rhythm, though you never
noticed me conceal a laugh to see you almost unrecognisably wrapped
in such infectious happiness.
So I celebrate, listening to Animal Collective
