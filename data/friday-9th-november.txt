STANDING ON THE VERGE OF ABSTRACTION:
The morning greets in cool greys & pinks -- a temperature so mild
that outdoors is the new "indoors". On waking, the first thing you said was,
"It makes me want to walk & walk... no talking, just walking with you".
Every morning, I look out the window to where there's a place on
the other side of the hill. It's full of ink & etching plates & calls to me,
wrapped in Brutalist Architecture, dug deep into the mud of Southern Essex.
White walls smeared with colours in my imagination, artisans dressed in
spattered aprons. Inspiration fuelled by the aroma of of indelible solutions
& store rooms stacked with acid free papers. The underscore today is
"Salmesykkel" by Moskus, suits my restless joy.
