LAST NIGHT IN MADRID:
I've loved playing these tracks for so long, so many good memories.
The faces replace the faces, but the love for this music remains -
what a journey. To have been a part of these rhythms, this band & this
friendship for so long is a rare & extraordinary thing for which
I will always be grateful & more than a little surprised.
A beautiful journey.
