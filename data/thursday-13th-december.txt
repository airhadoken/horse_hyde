He owned a beautiful piano that made you calm to play. It sounded best
at sundown,  just as the light was beginning to fade, if you hit "record"
that time of day something great would happen. It stood at the back of the
building in a tiny room with sky-lights, so you could get inspired by
the rhythm of dancing branches. The wind had been bitter for days,
long coats climbed down from hooks on the backs of toilet doors & everyone
remarked how fine they looked, --
"What, this old thing?!"
The piano had all it's coats off, stripped for action, direct injection,
exposed like a medical school cadaver. I slid onto it's velvet stool,
depressed the soft pedal & began to play,
"I think we should record", he grinned.
