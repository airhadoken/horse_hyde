(Come get some orange juice, it's great.) 
[repeated throughout the song, each time in different speaker] 
My eyes burn naked, 
my black cold numbers, 
my insecurities, 
my devious nature, 
make it go away. 
My rest between rubber, 
my spider shadow, 
my shattered dancer. 
Beautiful, broken, 
my crystal fingers, 
beautiful, broken, 
my crystal fingers. 
My glass like rain, 
my illumination, 
my cracks are sliding, 
shaker, feather, 
rubber, duster, 
cold, cool, 
your fingers, broken, 
beautiful, wonderful, 
paper flaps, 
how you love, 
love to love, 
love and stitch, 
shaker, rubber, striper. 
Beautiful, broken, 
my crystal fingers, 
beautiful, broken, 
my crystal fingers.
