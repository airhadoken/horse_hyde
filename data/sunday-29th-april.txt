UN-'SUN' DAY:
It's raining, cold & wet -- three bananas relax in a sheltered fruit bowl.
Essex howls & blows it's blossoms off -- everything turns uniform green.
Catch a train into a city that looks it's best shimmering, wet & shiny
on the last day of a "Month of Sundays." I'll miss the good people
at the BBC -- being plugged into the magic of broadcasting.
Stay warm & dry sisters & brothers.
