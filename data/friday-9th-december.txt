THE LAST WALTZ:
Before dawn the stars slipped from the sky like low cost airlines,
tail lights blinking. The moon was fat & yellow laughing at the sun
as it struggled to give us heat through a jungle of naked twigs.
We froze -- dancing in golden light. Our bodies coming back on line
in preparation for the last gig of the dancing season. Like brother
Zane said, we're "Taking the tourbus out've Essex" loaded with the
friends we take around the world & trust with our lives. A great way
to wrap up an extraordinary year before we lock down for the big one.
Anybody hungry to get physical?
