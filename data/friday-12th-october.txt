Relieved to be released from the city. Ten minutes driving around
in the rain alone, no conversation, no radio -- clouds lift, the sound
of  foam bubble popping. Feel the fingers on the wheel,
feet in contact with the pedals, lift water to the lips. "Alone" was a
life sentence, now it's like attending church. Turn the radio on,
surf the channels, discover jewels -- no conversation, just listen.
You're shaking, did you notice when it started? Slip into the sound
of the rain, the rhythm of oncoming lights, driving "sanctuary" to a
silent place.
