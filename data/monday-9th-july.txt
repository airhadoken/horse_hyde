WORDY NUMB-NUMB:
Pain inflicted from a loose mouth. A mind that speaks
before thinking. Another one hurt at the start of a simple day.
How many harmed this way? The journey of the wheelie bins,
a meditation for angry souls -- frustration. The birds, the wind,
the beautiful rhythm of early morning recedes beyond the bubble,
infected with over-active emotion whose only antidote may be
a quite incantation watching crows fly up from between grass
blades dripping with dew -- a simple kit of tools.
