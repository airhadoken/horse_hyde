ROOTS:
R.I.P. Tony Goodwin. He had great eyes that were full of light, a radiant smile
& dressed like no one else in town. A small town notices it's outsiders, but Tony
was both outside & in & well loved by many. He was the first musician I ever new
in our small community -- went around with a gold ring in his ear & an electric guitar
under his arm. He gave me hope & constant encouragement & when we too
took up the mantle of outsiders he would greet us with a beaming grin like he was
proud of us. More than Robert Plant or Geezer Butler who both lived in
our town. It was Tony Goodwin who made the idea of being a musician/artist seem
within our grasp & he made it all look so damn cool.
