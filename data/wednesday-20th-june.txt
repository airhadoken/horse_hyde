THINGS THAT GO BUMP IN THE NIGHT:
At 4:00am every morning the silence is broken by a low rushing
like the sound of an enormous turbine accompanied by a constant
whining. Tonight, if it happens again, I'm ready with a guitar
- I'm gonna write a song for it... with words & everything.
If you can't beat it, turn it into a concept album.
