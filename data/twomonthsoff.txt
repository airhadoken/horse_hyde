There was a little drawing of a heart next to that,
followed by an exclaimation mark.
The back of his was covered in stuff... stuff like:
Brandon is not a very nice guy, but Alex is sooo nice.
And that had the exclaimation thing too.
It was just silly crap that hit the spot. And he let himself be drawn in.
you bring light in... 
to a dark place 
walking in light 
glowing walking in light 
gold ring around you 
the hues of you 
the golden sunlight of you 
you bring light in... 
cool wind following 
following after you 
rising for you 
your skin beautiful 
everything comes natural 
fantastic fan 
rocking rocking floating
