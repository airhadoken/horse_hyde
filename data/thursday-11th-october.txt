WHAT'S THAT SMELL?:
The four hour journey to & from the studio, take-out food & constant
conversation. Working in a part of town that quickly bores or is it that
we're rooted to the same spot between four walls? Art made in boxes,
small & precious marks that make me want to respond with big & violent
brush strokes. Can't wait to be out've here.
