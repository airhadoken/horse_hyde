TOY TOWN:
The machines have been revolting, the internet is like a twisted piece of
old string -- a soggy paper cup at each end. Messages take ages to send,
but somehow everything is good.The electric toys are only frustrating if
you buy into their myth. Let it go & they become shiny electric door-stops.
This is for all the candle-makers living on the street of electricians.
