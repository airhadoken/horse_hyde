Sorry about the late posting, it's been a busy morning.
Head full of words like a cloud of noise. Best we let it settle
before we release it into the world eh? I remember, as a kid,
when the TV broadcasters had a breakdown in transmission
they would play a pre-recorded film clip, so, in the great tradition√Ç
of British broadcasting, he's some new art we're working on.
Goodvibes to you all from Essex.
