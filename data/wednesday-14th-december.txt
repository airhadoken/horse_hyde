NUDE DESCENDING A STAIRCASE:
A long morning behind the wheel begins before sunrise, passing through
Lemonworld, playing back & critiquing compositions. In this world we get
less time together than you'd imagine, so this time together before the phones
bay for attention is precious. Back at the castle, surrounded by a sea of
cardboard. It waits to receive the dancing marks but I'm driven to make music.
Sounds collide in fragments of light -- Illuminated slabs of shifting shapes
like Duchamp's "Nude Descending a Staircase"
