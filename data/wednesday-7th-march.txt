HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ONE'VE THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE?:
The boy with the glass spike in his ear shouts, "All day breakfast?!"
into a crowded room. Nobody notices his numb expression, carrying a plate
of unloved things. Back behind the bar he lifts a can to his lips called
"Sunshine" & sips -- catching two girls excited to be sat in the window,
clutching long & milky glasses  for the boys in fast cars to be lifted by
their radiance, thrilled by distraction, admire their skill at brightening-up
a day. But the fast cars found the by-pass, all the boys left town for ages --
gone to where the streets are paved in girls. And though poets flock in search
of the beauty of the mundane everything remains the same in this coffee chain.
Rammed to the gills with killers of time sheltering from deserted streets
soaked in rain.
