her sky wings...

havin a winj-  a winjer
today
today
i could be a downer about anything
i'm a winjer
havin' a winj-
everything
everything looks miserable
when you're a winjer
opinions enter the house of flame
when you're a winjer
i'm havin' a laugh
i'm havinalaugh
with the roof off
and the sunlit
take your top off
take your
take your top off
you look happy now
you look happy now
good spikes
(havinalaugh)
warm grass around you
warm grass around you
warm grass around you
i'm a winjer
today could be a downer
i could be a downer
about anything
everything looks miserable 
when you're a winjer
i'm
i'm i'm
i'm havin a laugh
with the roof off
and the sunlit
take your top off
take your top off
you look warm in the night
follows the road
warm grass around you
warm grass around you
