TRAVELING LIGHT:
Smiling, excited, expectant expressions supplant the distant eyes
& tired faces that usually travel on the trains into town. Even the
daily commuters seem to have electrified their usual dower demeanour.
The iPod & the pen & book, travelling companions in & out of the city
though writing on a crowded train is a very public affair. Words &
images mingle between the eye & ear. Only the violent "ping" of that
spring thing under ever train carriage makes me jump. No sounds
have transformed into threatening shapes all week, perhaps it's
the company I keep or a particular kind of lack of sleep making
new work in a tiny room next to the biggest show on earth.
