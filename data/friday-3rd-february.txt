I GOT A FILM IDEA FOR YOU:
She just twigged he's a wounded boy, a man with stories
that sniff him like dogs.
He says,
"I got a good film idea for you" & grins
"I don't mean to be rude" she cuts back in,
"but I got a deadline. Nice to see you", lowering her head.
The last of the light goes out've his eyes, re-tracing a line
back to the table where he slips back in behind the news
& inks up his delicate trembling fingers. The wallpaper yawns
& lets him in as she shudders involuntarily, remembering.
Back on music I was playing this last night.
