Was it the proximity of a full moon that fuelled such ferocious emotion?
Something had been odd all day, like the train was only half on the rails,
things were running to random time tables, toast was falling butter side
motion to get you from A-B-C, looking back to see how far you'd come,
not buying in to a badly wired day -- the trick of the trade. Now we're sat
around the kitchen table, dazed expressions, tired tracks up our backs,
rabbits that lived to see the other side of the black top, but only just.
