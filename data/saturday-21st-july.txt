PAINTING THE SHAPE OF YOUR NOISE:
Listening to the Joe Goddard remix of "Control" travelling home
in a trashed bubble the train tips me out at the wrong station
but the air is clean so I don't mind two fly boys mixing something
liquid fresh with something red looking wild eyed & frisky on the
platform leaving town for the bright lights  get a little action to set up
the weekend. I flick between "Seeing the Blossom" & "Solaris' to
distract me from the violent shapes attacking out've the noise of the day.
I can't be around loud sound too long, can't be in rooms of people.
Their words turn into violent forms that rush me & hurt.
There's an up side to this -- a lot've artwork gets generated,
capturing the dance of the violence of sound.
