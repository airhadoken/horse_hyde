Third day in a row riding trains to the Emerald City gathering poetry
like picking tea leaves off a Shrilankan hill side. Beautiful
barbed wire in full song -- images caught in an East London wind
by grand master Perou come in at night. Listening to the radio -- driving.
Listening to the Wizard's voice disguised as a commuter talking loud
on a cellphone in the morning. 
CDJ playing "The Agony & the Ecstasy" -- High Contrast
