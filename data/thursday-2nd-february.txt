FISHING THE SEAS FOR YOUR LOVE:
He's spinning her his best lines, talking rapid fire comedy electric.
She looks like she's lovin' it -- hooked & settled before the age.
He talks like a predator, reeling her in, but as the sun lights
the room I see in the detail her true expression -- she's no fool. Just killing timeÂ with a man-boy for the coffee & a little information, a sober judge
at the party of loose-tongued monkeys.
"Your's tantalising me now" he says squirming in his seat with excitement
"we have to meet again!"
And that's it -- he's blown his cover, colours firmly nailed to the pole.
Then suddenly perhaps in anticipation of the knock-back, he looks down at
his watch, goes pink, gets up & leaves.
