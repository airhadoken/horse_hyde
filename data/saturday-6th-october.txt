RABBITS IN THE CROWS:
Rabbits in the Crows & the Deer's in the Stubble-Corn,
Peckers in the Grass & Berries in the Thorn,
Chopper's in the Woodpile & Apples in the Apple-Press,
Baby's in the Z's & the Sun has got it's fingernails
Over the Horizon & the Train's on Time.
Listening to to Mungolian Jetset with a banjo on my knee
