I know exactly what happened, I got up in a really good mood, went fast walkin’
& got stuck into the studio without getting bogged down with the ’thinkin’ thing.
Words, Grooves, Music passing back & forth between the brother & me -
unrestricted, unleashed & uncaged. Following BBC Radio One extra of an evening,
driving down the back roads of Essex -- Sam Shepherd on my mind.
