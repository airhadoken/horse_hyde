Waking into sunlight from a night drenched in rain. A long way from
the rivers of the mirrored streets & pavements where muted tourists
clutched their bags amid night howlers & stagger boys in Mexican hats.
Where dark was lit up but dim & yellow, evoking nostalgia for something
yet to happen -- walking through a prophecy. Richter's squeegee sweeps
the sky, a dark & mustard brown turns radiant blue -- a trick perhaps
he didn't mean -- universally benevolent.
