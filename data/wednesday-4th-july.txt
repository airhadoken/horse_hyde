IN GIVING YOU RECEIVE:
"In giving you receive" said the woman on the radio as I listened between
making notes for the day & mouthfuls of porridge. It had been a long &
arduous night, woken by storms & bad dreams -- wandering around the
corridors wondering if I should stay up or attempt another sleep.
There are things that wait in there for us like school yard bullies,
caretakers of old fears & insecurities. They're all lies of course,
but when you're so dog tired your limbs ache it's not the most
rational state to separate fact from fear -you start your day feeling
it might've been better to stay awake. Another mouthful of porridge,
another line of notes & the woman on the radio tells a story so inspiring
that the residue of last night's fears crumbles to nothing.
