A DANCE IN FOOTSE:
The sun came dancing over the horizon in pinks, golds & purple-grey's.
The dirt clung to the soles of our shoes in orange clumps making succulent
rhythms as we walked. "Smalhans" by Lindstrom was playing on a lap top
in the kitchen & the skin on our faces stretched tight as drum as we came
to shelter from a chill wind.
