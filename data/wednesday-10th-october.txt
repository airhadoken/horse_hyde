FAMILIAR IN A STRANGER LAND:
Walking familiar streets through Japanese eyes I'm reminded how
exhausting it is to be in a foreign city. Everything is talking,
chattering, vying for attention. Everything is stimulating, amazing,
rich & oozing exotic information. Engaging with the world from
the head of an eighteen year old art student again is an exhausting
thrill & a blessing.
