IS THAT YOUR GRAT HE CHEWED?:
Resisting all temptation he stepped back & watched beloved puddings
disappear, enjoyed instead the happiness of revellers in paper crowns.
The games of charades & cards, the laughter of reunited families from
past years was replaced by solitary collisions with crystal balls,
tiny electronics connected some to worlds beyond. As families gathered
to reacquaint themselves with the healing sound of one other's laughter,
some were conspicuous by absence, leaving only shells bearing vague
resemblances to their former selves. At sunrise he was drawn back to the
alter, the table laid with morning fare. Hung over from the cheese pickle,
but happy to be once more surrounded by such wonderful faces.
